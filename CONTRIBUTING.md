Clearly explain why the enhancement would be beneficial and how it would improve the project.
Submitting Pull Requests
Fork the repository and create your branch from main (or the default branch).
Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the latest changes.
Follow coding standards (see below) and include comments when necessary.
Include tests for any new features or bug fixes.
When submitting a pull request, provide a detailed description of what the changes include.
Reference any related issue numbers in your pull request description.
Steps to submit a pull request:

Fork the repository.
Clone your fork: git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git.
Create a branch for your work: git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name.

Commit your changes: git commit -m "Added feature: [description]".
Push your branch to GitHub: git push origin feature/your-feature-name.
Open a pull request from your branch to the main branch of the main repository.


3. Coding Standards
Follow the coding style guidelines provided for the project. If none are specified:
Use meaningful variable and function names.
Keep functions and classes small and focused on a single task.
Include comments to describe non-obvious code behavior.
Avoid hardcoding values; use constants or configurations where necessary.
Remove unused code, including commented-out sections.
Write code that is easy to understand and maintain.

Languages/Technologies: [Specify any language/technology-specific guidelines if needed]

5. Commit Guidelines
Use clear, concise commit messages. Structure them like this:


-  Short description of the changes made

Detailed explanation of the changes made in this commit (if necessary).
Types of commits:

feat: for new features
fix: for bug fixes
docs: for documentation changes
style: for code formatting changes (e.g., linting)
refactor: for code restructuring without changing its behavior
test: for adding or updating tests
chore: for other routine tasks
Use imperative mood in commit messages (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update").

5. Testing
Write tests for any new features or changes.
Run existing tests to ensure you haven't broken anything.
Ensure your code passes any automated tests, including linting checks, before submitting a pull request.
